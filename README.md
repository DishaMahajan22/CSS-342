# CSS-342
The folders above consist of all my programs from my CSS 342 (Data Structures and Algorithms class)

#### Program 1
This program had two parts. In the first part I was supposed to design a class which models a coin operated vending bank (vending_bank.h). For the second part I was supposed to design and implement a TimeSpan class which represented a duration of time in hours, minutes, and seconds. 

####Program 2
This program had two parts. For the first part I was supposed to write a program called Catalan which takes one argument on the command line and calls a 
recursive function which computes the nth Catalan number. The second part of the project required me to code the movement of a robot. More specifically, I was supposed to write a recursive program which determined all the unique shortest possible paths from the robot to the treasure with the following stipulation: The robot may never move in the same direction more than max_distance times in a row.

####Program 3
For this program I was supposed to build a class for a fully ordered list. The list class, called List342, had to be templatized so that it could handle different types of objects. It also should contain a function which can read a file and input those items in order inside the list. I also programmed various functions such as the Insert and Remove function for the list. 

####Program 4
I was supposed to code various sorting algorithms: Bubble, Insertion, Merge, IterativeMerge, Quick, and Shell sort.

####Program 5
I had to code a banking application which could process transactions. 

Three key things I had to implement: 
- The program will read in a string of transactions from a file into an in-memory queue. 
These transactions can open accounts, withdraw funds, deposit funds, transfer funds, or ask for 
the transactional history to be printed. 
- The program will next read from the queue and process the transactions in order. 
- When the queue has been depleted the program will print out all open accounts and 
balances in those accounts.
